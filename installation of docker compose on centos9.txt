To be able to use docker-compose command, you first need to install docker-compose on your system. The installation steps are quite straightforward.

You can skip this step if you used Terraform to set up your lab, as docker-compose is already installed.

To install docker-compose on Centos 9, we can use the curl command to download a stable docker-compose release
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Now, letâ€™s assign the execution permission to the file:
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

Once that is done, you can check the version with the command:
docker-compose --version

The output will be something like docker-compose version 1.29.2, build 5becea4c
