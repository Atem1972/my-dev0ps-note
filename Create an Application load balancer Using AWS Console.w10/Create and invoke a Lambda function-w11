Invoke the Lambda function

After creating a lambda function, we need to invoke it. To do that:

    Scroll down to the Code source section

    Click on Test dropdown and select Configure Test event

    Select Create new event then, enter the Event name: test1

    Scroll down the page and click on Save

Now, check the execution result by clicking on the Test button. The Execution result shows the execution status as succeeded.

This is just a simple demo of creating and invoking a lambda function. 
Clean up

If you are done working with the example function, delete it.
To delete the Lambda function we created, scroll up on the function page then click on Actions
Choose Delete function

In the Delete function dialog box, choose Delete.
