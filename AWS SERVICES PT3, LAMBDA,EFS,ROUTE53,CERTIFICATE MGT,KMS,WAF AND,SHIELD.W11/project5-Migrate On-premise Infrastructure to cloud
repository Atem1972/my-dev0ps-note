Scope

ICARE, One of your clients, currently operates a web and mobile application for its customers. This application relies on a REST API, with the web portion being served from dedicated static content servers. Additionally, the application utilizes a central customer database and a corporate mail server for its functionalities. Access logs are sent to a distinct storage system, and employees also rely on a separate application (such as a CRM or ERP system) that shares the same database.

NOTE: All elements of this setup are currently hosted within a single datacenter on bare metal hosts. Load balancers and servers each have two replicas, with the database consisting of a primary and a read replica.
What is expected of you?

ICARE is considering migrating as much of this infrastructure as possible to the AWS cloud. This decision stems from the need to address challenges related to scaling the web and app tiers as customer demand grows, as well as the desire for increased redundancy, and disaster recovery,  given the current reliance on a single datacenter.

So your task is to propose an architecture design on AWS cloud that will mitigate the on-premise infrastructureâ€™s challenges.

See the infrastructure diagram below.

 

Note that you are not required to migrate the whole architecture, but you should migrate as mush a possible.
