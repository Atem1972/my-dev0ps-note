    Log into your AWS account and go to the ECS service.

    In the ECS service, click on Create Cluster.

    On the form, Enter the cluster name 

    Now scroll down to the bottom and click on Create.

    Now wait for the cluster to be created. once the creation is done, you should get the output below 

    Now the Next thing is to create a task definition to run our Nginx image.

    On the side bar click on Task definitions

    On the page that shows up, click on Create new task definition

    On the page that shows up, enter the task name and the image name then the URI of the image.

Note that if your image is on ECR, enter the image URL, not just the image name.

    Now scroll down and click on Create after reviewing.

    Once the task is created, we will need to run it.

    At the top of the page, click on  Deploy

    Now click on Create Service

    On the page that shows up, select the Cluster that you created

Then scroll down to the Service Name and enter the service name

    Leave the rest unchanged then scroll down and click Create

    Once the service is created, scroll down and click  on Tasks

    Then select the task you created (2)

    On the page that shows up, click on Open address

Note: Open the Networking tab of your task To ensure that port 80 is open in the security group, edit the inbound rule and allow traffic on port 80. By doing so, you enable incoming HTTP traffic.

It would be best if you got the output below

Congratulations you Deployed your first image on ECS, you can now go ahead and continue with the slide.
