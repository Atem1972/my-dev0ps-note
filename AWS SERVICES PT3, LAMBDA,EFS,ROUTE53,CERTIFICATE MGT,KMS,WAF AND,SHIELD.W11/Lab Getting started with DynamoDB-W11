In this Lab, we are going to do the following actions:

    Create a table for the DevOps team in DynamoDB

    Write data in the created table (insert records)

    Read, Update and query data

    Clean up 

Prerequisites: 

Before starting this lab, you must have an AWS account
Create a table in DynamoDB

Here, we are going to create a table called devopsteam. This table will contain some information about each member of the DevOps team at the company (Name, Position, Contact, Years)

To create the table, you need to: 

    Login to your AWS account, click Services, then go to the Database domain. Select DynamoDB

    Now, click on the button Create table

    Enter the name of the table: devopsTeam

    For the Partition key, enter Name and for the Sort key, enter Position

    Allow other parameters as default and scroll down to click on Create table 

 Insert items in the table

To insert an item in the table devopsTeam, follow the steps:

    Click on the Table name in the list of DynamoDB tables: devopsTeam

    Click on the Explore table items button

    Scroll down and click on Create item

 

Let’s add a new attribute to the table for the contact of the members.

    Click on Add new attribute drop down, then select Number to add the team member’s contact

    Do the same, and select Number to add the number of years in the company

 

    Put in some values and click on Create item

Repeat the process and create 2 other items:

Item 2:

    Name: Emma David

    Position: member

    Contact: 345675432

    Years: 3

Item 3:

    Name: Kelvin Martin

    Position: member

    Contact: 9809870978

    Years: 3

Read update and query data from the table

After creation, the items are available in the item list and you can consult any and modify them if necessary.

Let’s run a query to get the number of years Kelvin Martin in the company for example:

    In the DynamoDB tables, click on the table name: devopsTeam

    Then, click on the button Explore table items

    Now click on Query. Click on the drop-down under Select attribute projection and choose Specific attributes

 

     Enter the attribute name (Years) and the Name of the member (Kelvin Martin) 

    Click on Run to execute the query and see what you get 

You can run more queries to better understand
Delete the table

Deleting a table is quite simple. Click on Tables on the left column under Dashboard

Select the tables' check button then click on Delete

Confirm the deletion in the pop-up that opens and that’s it!

Everything that is done in the AWS console interface can also be done with the AWS CLI.

Exercise: Find the AWS CLI commands needed to create the table, create, list, update the items we did in this demo, and delete the table.
